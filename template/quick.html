    <h1>Bubble Sort</h1>
    <p>Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and
        swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It passes through the list multiple times until no more swaps are
        needed, indicating that the list is sorted.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Comparison and Swap: </b> Bubble sort compares adjacent pairs of elements in the list. If they are in the
            wrong order (e.g., smaller followed by larger), it swaps them.</li>
        <li><b>Passes through the list: </b> It makes multiple passes through the list. After each pass, the largest
            unsorted element 'bubbles up' to its correct position.</li>
        <li><b>Repeat until sorted: </b>The process is repeated until the list is sorted. Each pass through the list
            places the next largest element in its correct position.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Consider sorting the array [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3] using bubble sort:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pass 1: </b>Compare and swap adjacent elements if necessary. After the first pass, the largest element
            <b>6</b> moves to the end.</li>
        <li>[2, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6]</li>
        <li><b>Pass 2: </b>Continue comparing and swapping. After the second pass, the next largest element <b>5</b>
            moves to its correct position.</li>
        <li>[2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6]</li>
        <li><b>Pass 3: </b>Repeat until sorted. After further passes, smaller elements move towards the beginning, and
            eventually, the array becomes sorted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Characterstics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Simple and easy to understand.</b></li>
        <li><b>Inefficient for large datasets: </b>Has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of ùëÇ(ùëõ^2)</li>
        <li><b>Stable: </b>Maintains the relative order of equal elements.</li>
        <li><b>In-place: </b>Requires only a constant amount of additional space.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bubble sort is not commonly used in practice for sorting large datasets due to its poor performance compared to
        more efficient algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. However, it is often used to illustrate basic sorting
        algorithms in educational settings due to its simplicity.</p>
